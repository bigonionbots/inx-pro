/**
 * @file AudioLinkProtocol.h
 * @brief Wire protocol between the T5 (inx-pro, `t5s3_audio`) and the audio module (audio-module/).
 *
 * Shared verbatim by both firmwares, so keep it dependency-free C++.
 *
 * Frame (little endian):
 *
 *   0xA5 0x5A | type u8 | seq u8 | length u16 | payload[length] | crc16 u16
 *
 * crc16 is CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over type, seq, length and payload. A receiver hunts for the
 * magic, drops frames with a bad CRC or an oversized length, and resynchronises on the next magic.
 *
 * T5 -> module ("host" frames) are reliable, go-back-N: every frame carries the next sequence
 * number; the module accepts only the expected one and answers with ACK(nextSeq, rxFree). An
 * out-of-sequence frame (one before it was lost or damaged) gets an ACK flagged OUT_OF_SEQUENCE,
 * on which the host resends its window from nextSeq at once; RESEND_TIMEOUT_MS without progress
 * is only the fallback. The host keeps at most MAX_INFLIGHT_BYTES unacknowledged, so draining
 * them never takes long on a slow bridge (resending a window that was merely slow collapses the
 * link). Audio flow control rides on the same ACK: the host keeps the audio bytes in
 * unacknowledged frames at or below the last rxFree.
 *
 * Module -> T5 frames are small and idempotent (ACK, periodic STATUS, scan results), so they
 * carry seq 0 and are never resent. Keep them short: some bridges (the ATOM Lite's FTDI
 * emulation, see docs/audio-module.md) have no flow control in that direction.
 *
 * Positions: STREAM_START names a stream id and the book position the data starts at. The
 * module counts playedMs from that point in source samples actually sent to the output, so
 * host position = startMs + STATUS.playedMs for the matching stream id.
